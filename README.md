# ecommerce-back-end

  ## Description
  I am exploring building the back end for an e-commerce site. I worked with Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Because this application wonâ€™t be deployed, I have created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

  ## Installation
  You will need to install the following:
  - dotenv
  - mysql2
  - sequelize
  - express
  
  ## Usage
  This project be used to Create, Update, Delete and Get Products, Categories, and Tags from an Ecommerce Website.
